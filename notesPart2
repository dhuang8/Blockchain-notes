# Ethereum Notes
  https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-ethereum/

Blockchain tech has more applications than digital currency and its association with bitcoin

Electronic voting & digitally recorded property assets to regulatory compliance and trading are now being actively developed and deployed faster than ever. 

Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications

Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network

## So is there a difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin???

YES! Ethereum and Bitcoin differ substantially in purpose and capability: 
	- Bitcoin offers one particular application of blockchain technology.
	- The Ethereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. 
	- In the Ethereum Blockchain miners work to earn Ether, a type of cryptotoken that fuels the network. 
	- Ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network
	- Ethereum is based on blockchain technology where all transactions are meant to be irreversible and unchangeable. 

## What is a Smart Contract?

Smart Contract: just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares and anything of value

On a blockchain the smart contract becomes like a self operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. 

## Smart contracts run exactly as programmed, and there is:
		+ no  possibility of censorship
		+ downtime
		+ fraud or third party interference


An option contact between parties is written as code in the blockchain. The individuals are anonymous but contact is on public ledger

A triggering event is like an expiration date, and strike price is hit and the contract executes its self according to the coded terms

Regulators can use the blockchain to understand the activity in the market while maintaining privacy.

Vitalik Buterin: developed Ethereum 

Ethereum’s core innovation, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a Turing complete software that runs on Ethereums’s network

EVM allows anyone to run a program, regardless of programming language and given enough time and memory

the EVM makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier/efficient

Ethereum enables the development of potentially thousands of different applications on one platform

Ethereum enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications or a Dapp.

Bitcoin is a Dapp, which is an abbreviated form for decentralized applications. It has a backend code running on a decentralized peer to peer network. 

Any services that are centralized can be decentralized using Ethereum (I believe mozzilla is currently looking for someone to decentralize the web for them). 

Ethereum can also be used to build a Decentralized Autonomous organization (DAO).

## What is a DAO??

A DAO is a fully autonomous decentralized organization with no single leader. 

DAO’s are run by programming code on a collection of smart contracts written on the Ethereum blockchain. 

zthe code is designed to replace the rules and structure of a traditional organization, eliminating the need for people and centralized control. 

A DAO is owned by everyone who purchases tokens, but instead of each token equating to equity shares & ownership, tokens act as contributions that give people voting rights.

## Ethereum Decentralized Platform:

	-Immutability: a third party cannot take any changes to data
	-Corruption & tamper proof: apps are based on a network formed around the principle consensus, making censorship impossible
	- Secure: no central ports of failure and secured through cryptography 	
applications are well protected against hacking attacks & fraudulent activities.
	- Zero Downtime: apps never go down and can never be switched off. 
    - Smart contracts are only as good as the people who write them 
    - any action taken by a central party raises serious questions about the decentralized nature of an application.

## To access Ethereal you need to access its native Mist Browser. 

Mist provides a user-friendly interface & digital wallet for users to trade & store Ether as well as write, manage, deploy and use smart contracts. 

Like web browsers give access and help people navigate the internet, Mist provides a portal into the world of decentralized blockchain applications.

There is also the MetaMask browser extension, which turns google chrome into an Ethereum browser.

 MetaMask allows anyone to easily run or develop decentralized applications from their browser.
